bugs worth mentioning: from what I can see, everything seems to work now except

I couldn't come up with a way to write a leading zero for the valve number when WRITING to the SD card. (The read function always reads 6 characters so if the valve number is less than 10 which would result in 5 characters, the read order gets messed up).

Also, when calling the SPI function within the write function, the data writing to the SD card gets messed up.

Lastly, when using the SPI function after writing to the SD card, there's a huge delay in writing the next 10-b data (that's why I commented it out for now).
